<h1>About LensShift</h1>
<p>Development is broken. With countless examples of harmful development and social change initiatives, many are using the poor as their playground full of toys to build their careers, boost their egos and fill their wallets. Such misguided, self-congratulatory “change-makers” are creating more and more damage every single day. Those that try to shine a spotlight, often feel like it’s much too large and complex of a beast to expose at once. They produce pieces that are incredibly powerful but, in the grander scheme, remain simply a single shard of a scattered mosaic. In the age of information overload, LensShift is a platform stitching together a mirror that cultivates a critical, informed perspective. Rather than replicating the compelling work of others, we bring together their wisdom so that the status quo does not persist. We are reframing social change. </p>
